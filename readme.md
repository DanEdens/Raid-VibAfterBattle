It is a notification with options to set either do either/or a vibration, screenshot, or mqtt message at the conclusion of every battle. 

This means you can start a match, put it in your pocket, and not have to keep checking it to tell when the round ends.
 
(The screenshot is good for using a mobile autoclicker, and was really just an afterthought. I can do whatever silly thing you want.
plus It uses system screenshot, so your normal cloud backup service will let you check the auto-run status remotely.)
